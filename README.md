<img width=100% src="https://github.com/lazy-ocean/a11y-showcase-museum/blob/main/public/demo.gif" alt='a11y showcase demo'/>

This is an a11y playground/showcase sample website made during **[Accessibility Unity](https://accessibilityunity.com/)** learning course. Tested with macOS VoiceOver, keyboard-friendly. Only the main functionality presented, the goal was to tackle frontend challenges such as modals, forms, tabs, carousel, language, and theme switching, keeping everything _as much accessible, valid and user-friendly as possible_.
